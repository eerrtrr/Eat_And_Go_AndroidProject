# Android_project

Hope Mr. Mollinari will see that.

Just want to let you know that the app that he will test is not my original final version. When you asked me to make my repository public
I had the idea to check if everything was okay on it.
I realize that all my commits and pushes wasn't here and so I started to touch at git manually by copying and pasting .git file and my android files.

Obviously it finally worked, I double checked by cloning somewhere my repository. But something wrong happened during the last commit, and I still do 
not understand why half of my layouts disappeared, but nothing else.

So you only have half of my design for this project, I'm so sorry for that, that's all my fault. I had to take one of the backup that I got somehere with the ancient awful design.
Hope it will works because I couldn't test and I touched lots of things during this last-minute rush.

Thanks for all your courses, your investments and to have tried to make me like Android dev, but Android Studio and I are not a love story.
